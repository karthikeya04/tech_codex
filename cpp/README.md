# Cpp
## Sources for learning the language
The good ones
- [CppCon youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/cppcon)
- [ISO CPP](https://isocpp.org/)

Also [Learn C++](https://www.learncpp.com/) seems like a good place to quickly get an overview of standard and modern aspects of C++

## Compilation
[An Introduction to GCC](./resources/gccintro.pdf) is a good place to start
- A short resource that should arguably only take a few hours to read
- Provides a good high level overview of the Compilation process and options to control it

## Build systems
TODO. Tenatatively I think the following would be good
- [GNU's Make manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.pdf) should give an overview of a simple BUILD system
- TODO I plan to go through and understand the Bazel BUILD sytem and add relevant references here
